This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in R programming: accessing a non-existent column in a data frame. The code in `bug.R` attempts to perform a calculation using a column ('C') that does not exist in the data frame.  This does not throw an error but instead returns `NA` values.  The solution, in `bugSolution.R`, shows how to check for the existence of columns using `%in%` or `hasName()` before attempting to use them.
